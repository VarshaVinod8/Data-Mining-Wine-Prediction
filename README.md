# Data-Mining-Wine-Prediction

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data set is taken from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Input variables:
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

The four models used by us are :
1. decision tree
2. random forest 
3. logistic regression
4. KNN

Random tree gives the highest accuracy 0.93125
